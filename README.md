Mentorship matching system

This project uses the Greedy Algorithm to match mentees with mentors based on shared traits such as identity, communication preferences, academic major, and other factors. The goal is to save time, reduce errors compared to manual matching, and ensure compatible, meaningful mentorship connections.

It was originally built in Colab, but  has now been improved with Python and Flask to include a frontend, making it more user-friendly. Now, you can upload CSVs, see the matching results, and interact with the system through a web interface.
